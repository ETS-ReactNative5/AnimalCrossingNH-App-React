            "https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet": "Hi, welcome to the item spreadsheet for ACNH!\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/24: Unlocked toy day items, added new column called Season/Event Exclusive for obtainability outside of the respective season, removed Unlock Notes and Mannequin Piece columns, added new sort column to reactions tab, minor changes and fixes all around.\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/04: Fix some regressions regarding source notes introduced in the last update. Add a \"Festive shopping\" season used for some Able Sisters items that were wrongly assigned to the \"ornaments\" crafting season. Add \"Mannequin Season\" column (overrides Able Sisters' seasons). Mannequin Piece column will be removed soon.\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/03: Add new Seasons and Events tab with relevant dates. Most tabs now have new Season/Event columns to match items to their respective events. Source Notes will be updated soon to remove redundant season/event info. Unlock Notes columns will soon be removed (but not the \"Unlocked?\" column) â€” BCAT and NTP unlock details will now reside in the Seasons and Events tab in a more structured manner.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of our spreadsheet is to create a complete collection of data on items, villagers, achievements, and more! We fully welcome the use of our data for creators to make websites or applications from for the betterment of the Animal Crossing community. If you use our data for an app or site, please provide a link back to the spreadsheet on your page, and contact us to get your name added to the list of partners."
