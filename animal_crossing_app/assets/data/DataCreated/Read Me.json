Added time columns of Seasons and Events tab for event start and end times. Filled in empty cells on posters and set empty Season/Event cells to NA. Minor fixes all around.\r\n\r\nUpdate 02/13: Added new \"Pattern Customize Options\" column to furniture tabs to indicate what patterns can be used to customize the item. Finalized \"Seasons and Events\" tab with new \"Sort Date\" and \"Date Varies by Year\" columns, as well as all event dates from 2000-2060. Deleted multiple columns from \"Seasons and Events\" tab. Removed/replaced/added many events and seasons (check discord changelog for specifics). Minor changes and fixes all around. Most tabs are now sorted from A-Z or by ID.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of our spreadsheet is to create a complete collection of data on items, villagers, achievements, and more! We fully welcome the use of our data for creators to make websites or applications from for the betterment of the Animal Crossing community.
