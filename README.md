# AnimalCrossingNH-App-React
Rewrite of the original app from scratch in React Native.
The goal of this rewrite is to make a more modular application that can be updated easier. The original app written in Flutter had various bugs relating to asynchronous function calls, reactive component layouts, and lacked a modular design with much repetitive code. After learning ReactJS, this project was started to learn React Native.
